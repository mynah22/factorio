# gleba factory

## flow

1. fruit is transported to bus unprocessed
2. circuit network (tries?) to keep all spots planted, but only harvest when needed
3. sub factories process fruit on site (spoils slower)
4. nutrients will have to flow upstream
5. nutrients can also be made from spoilage at start of subfactories
6. spoilage is drained from all subfactories and put on belt
7. spoilage is run through spoilage drain subfactory (carbon, nutrients), then burned at end of belt
