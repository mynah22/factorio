# gleba factory

## flow

1. fruit is transported to bus unprocessed (spoils slowly)
2. circuit network (tries?) to keep all spots planted, but only harvest when needed
3. sub factories process fruit on site (spoils slower)
4. nutrients will have to flow upstream
5. nutrients can also be made from spoilage at start of subfactories
6. bacteria outputs to smelters, which output to belt
7. spoilage is drained from all subfactories and put on belt
8. spoilage is run through spoilage drain subfactory (carbon, nutrients), then burned at end of belt

## items

- raw jellyfruit
  - makes jelly
- raw yamako
  - makes yamako mash
- bioflux
  - made from mash and jelly
  - used for everything good
    - plastic
      - mash + bioflux
    - sulfur
      - spoilage + bioflux
    - rocket fuel
      - jelly + bioflux
    - bacteria (ore)
    - sci
      - pentapod + bioflux
- spoilage
  - made everywhere from waste
- nutrients
  - required for biochambers to run
  - made from spoilage, yamako mash, or bioflux
    - bioflux is by far the most productive recepie
- carbon
  - made from spoilage
  - made into carbon fiber
- bacteria
  - uses bioflux to breed bacteria
  - bacteria spoils to ore
- pentapod eggs
  - spoil to live pentapods, must be contained in defenses
  - used for biochambers and sci
- carbon fiber
  - advanced recepie material
  - carbon + mash
- jelly
  - used for various recepies, and lubricant

## belt arrangement

- stone piped directly to mall / finished goods subfactory
- 2 belts nutrients? up and down?
- 4 belts each jellyfruit / yamako (dream big)
- 4 belts each jelly / mash
  - created at early subfactories
- 4 belts bioflux
- bioflux > nutrient self sustaining subfactory early
  - or maybe on site?
- big bioflux factory (maybe produce jelly / mash on site)
- both bacteria, sulfur, plastic, rocket fuel subfactories
- smelters for ore
- metal, sulfur, plastic get shipped to mall / finished goods factory
- rocket fuel gets sent to rocket / logistic network
  - some sulfur stays for coal production
- pentapod subfactory
  - circuit network control to limit eggs in storage
  - defenses for spoilage
- science subfactory
- lubricant subfactory
  - piped to mall / finished goods factory (blue belts, electric engines)
- carbon subfactory (spoilage)
- carbon fiber subfactory (carbon + mash)
  - goes to mall / finished goods factory (rocket turrets, toolbelt expander, fusion reactor, stack inserter)
- coal subfactory (carbon + sulfur)
  - goes to mall / finished goods factory (for explosives & grenades)
- spoilage > nutrient subfactory
- spoilage burner
